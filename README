VNCview GS 1.0a2 README

VNCview GS is a VNC client (viewer) for the Apple IIgs.  You can use it to display and interact with the graphical desktop of another computer through your Apple IIgs.

System Requirements
A (real or emulated) ROM 01 or ROM 3 Apple IIgs
Apple IIgs System Software 6.0.1
Marinetti 2.0 or later, with a functional TCP/IP network connection
Andrew Roughan's Crypto Tool Set (needed for password functionality)
A computer running a VNC server to which you have access
Strongly recommended:
An accelerator
A high-bandwidth, low-latency network connection from the IIgs to the server

Marinetti can be downloaded from:
http://www.apple2.org/marinetti/ (stable versions)
http://sourceforge.net/projects/marinetti (development/beta versions)

The Crypto Tool Set can be downloaded from:

VNCview GS will generally perform best when connected to the VNC server through a high-bandwidth, low-latency network connection.  A IIgs connected to the network via a high-speed network connection such as a LANceGS and a server connected to your LAN will probably provide the best performance.

Usage
To start VNCview GS, simply run the "VNCview.GS" program.  The New VNC Connection dialog box will be displayed, allowing you to configure and start a VNC connection.

Usually, you need to enter the VNC server (using a hostname or IP address and a VNC display number, as in other VNC programs) and a password.  Some servers may not require a password, but most do and it is probably advisable to set up your own servers with a password to provide some security.  Also note that the VNC display number can be omitted if it is 0, and that it can be negative.

You can select a 320x200 color or 640x200 grayscale display mode.  The 320x200 mode better corresponds to the server's normal display, since it displays colors and uses near-square pixels.  640x200 mode will cause greater distortion and does not display colors, but it does allow a larger portion of the server's desktop to be displayed on the IIgs.

Other options are also available.
"Request shared session" indicates the server should allow multiple clients to connect to it simultaneously.  The server is not required to honor this request.
"Emulate 3-Button Mouse" causes option-clicks and OA-clicks to be  treated as clicks of the second and third mouse buttons.
"View Only Mode" allows you to see the server's display but not to send any keyboard, mouse, or clipboard input to the server.
"Allow Clipboard Transfers from Server" indicates that the server is allowed to send its clipboard contents, which will be transferred to the IIgs clipboard.

The "Preferred Encoding" is the method that will be used to represent pixels on the server's display when sending them to the IIgs; the available options are Raw and Hextile.  The Raw encoding sends lines of pixel values to the IIgs, while Hextile represents the display as a collection of small rectangular areas.  One of these methods will likely be faster than the other in your configuration; the best way to tell which is faster for you is to try out both.  In general, Hextile encoding is best for low-bandwidth connections like dial-up modems, while Ethernet and other relatively high-bandwidth connections may give better performance with the Raw encoding.  Some servers may not support Hextile encoding, in which case Raw will be used regardless of this setting.  VNCview GS also supports the "CopyRect" encoding regardless of this setting; it should always be faster than both Raw and Hextile but can only be used in limited circumstances.

When you have configured your new VNC connection, simply click "Connect," and if all goes well you will be connected to the VNC server.  You can interact with it with the mouse and keyboard and scroll your view of its display.  The option and Open-Apple keys are sent as "alt" and "meta," respectively; their exact interpretation depends on the server.  Keyboard shortcuts for menu items are disabled when connected so that these key combinations can be sent to the server.  Select "Close" or "Quit" in the File menu when you are done with the connection.

Menu Items
Apple->About VNCview GS...: Displays information about the program
File->New Connection: Allows you to configure and establish a new connection
File->Close: Closes current window or connection.  You can connect again afterward.
File->Quit: Quits VNCview GS, closing any open connection
Edit->Undo: Only used by NDAs
Edit->Cut/Copy/Paste/Clear: Used in New VNC Connection window input boxes and NDAs
Edit->Show Clipboard: Displays the current contents of the IIgs clipboard
Edit->Send Clipboard: Transfers the contents of the IIgs clipboard to the server

VNC Server Interoperability
VNCview GS should be able to connect with any VNC server that fully implements the RFB protocol as published by RealVNC Ltd. or its predecessors, though in practice it seems to work better with some servers than with others.  Here is a list of some VNC servers for widespread platforms; many others are also available.

Microsoft Windows & *nix (X11): RealVNC, http://www.realvnc.com/
Mac OS (9 and X): OS9vnc / OSXvnc, http://www.redstonesoftware.com/vnc.html

Troubleshooting
If you are experiencing problems, it may be helpful to try removing, rearranging, or even adding system extensions.  This may eliminate assorted problems associated with Marinetti and its interaction with other components of the system.  Upgrading to the latest version of Marinetti (3.0b1 as of this writing) may also be helpful.

If these steps fail to resolve your problems or if you have other questions, comments, or bug reports, I can be contacted at SHeumann@myrealbox.com.

Please be aware that VNCview GS is alpha-quality software.  It generally works for me, but it has not been extensively tested in diverse environments, and it is not necessarily feature-complete.
